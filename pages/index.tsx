    <b>Hello!</b> My name is Qian and I am a software engineer with over 12
    years of experience building web, primarily in fintech. I began creating webpages during the geocities
    days and had the pain and pleasure of coding through the eras. In college I obsessed over FPGA and C++. But I
    eventually found my way back home in webdev. I love the bleeding edge of what web can do, and look forward to
    the day when we can have native animation APIs, gRPC streaming, and runtime es6 imports. Hit me up if I missed the boat.
