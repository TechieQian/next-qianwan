    <b>Hello!</b> I'm Qian and I'm a software engineer with over 15 years of
    experience building scalable web application at the intersection of finance
    and tech. Throughout my career I've built demo prototypes for fintech
    startups and orchestrated large, multi team efforts at big tech.

      At LinkedIn I was the lead for editorial tooling, and also part of the
      moon shots organization where I piloted LinkedIn's first AI feature in
      collaborative articles and also laying the foundations for LinkedIn games.

      I built the next generation of tech stack and trained up teams of web
      developers at Blackstone. I am currently at Jain Global, hands on building
      the entire suite of highly complex and ambitious tools for our risk
      takers. My work is driven by the cross section of high craftsmanship,
      rapid execution, and results-oriented leadership.
