    <b>Hello!</b> My name is Qian and I am a software engineer with over 12
    years experience in fintech. I began creating webpages during the geocities
    days and had the pain and pleasure of coding through the eras. In college I
    majored in computer engineering and obsessed over FPGA and C++. But I
    eventually found my way back home in webdev and lean towards Front-End. I
    enjoy interface-driven architecture whether it be a React component or a
    protobuff file. Simplicity is complicated. Talk to me about React, browser
    engines, and reasons we don't have gRPC streaming over web yet.
